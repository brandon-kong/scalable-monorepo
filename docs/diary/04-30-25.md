## Small things I learned today

NextAuth has a type issue with destructing the NextAuth handler.

For example:

```ts
const { handlers, auth, ... } = NextAuth(authConfigs);
                  ^ type error
```

The fix to this was accessing each value in the handler by its key.

```ts
const handler = NextAuth(authConfigs);
const auth: AuthType = handler["auth"]
...
```

Very annoying and inconvenient bug!
