## Small things I learned today

The `transpilePackages` attribute in `next.config.js` is used to specify which packages should be transpiled. This is useful for monorepo projects where you'd want to enable hot reloading for packages that are not in the `node_modules` directory. See the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/transpilePackages)
