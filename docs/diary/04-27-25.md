## Small things I learned today

For Turborepo projects, including a `basePath` and `paths` in a shared `tsconfig.json` can help with path resolution across packages. This is useful for monorepos that have multiple Next.js applications where you'd want to alias app-specific paths such as `~/components` rather than writing out the full path to the component in each app.

The `basePath` does not resolve in the shared `tsconfig.json`; it only resolves when it's extended in the app's `tsconfig.json`.

I came across an issue with setting up TailwindCSS with the Monorepo. I realized that my base tailwind CSS file needed to have the `@source` directive in order to detect the classes in other workspaces. Adding that, along with importing the compiled base CSS file into `dist` and exporting that in the `package.json` file, resolved the issue. From each app and workspace, I just need to import the compiled CSS file from the `dist` folder.
