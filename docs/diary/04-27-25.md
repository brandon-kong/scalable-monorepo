## Small things I learned today

For Turborepo projects, including a `basePath` and `paths` in a shared `tsconfig.json` can help with path resolution across packages. This is useful for monorepos that have multiple Next.js applications where you'd want to alias app-specific paths such as `~/components` rather than writing out the full path to the component in each app.

The `basePath` does not resolve in the shared `tsconfig.json`; it only resolves when it's extended in the app's `tsconfig.json`.
