# Things I learned

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### VS Code

- `Ctrl + K + W` - Close all editors

### Vim

- `:line_number` - Go to line number
- `gg` - Go to the first line of the file
- `G` - Go to the last line of the file

## Typescript

In the command:
```bash
tsc --noEmit
```
does not generate any output files such as JavaScript files. This makes it possible to just run TS code without needing to first compile and run JS code.
